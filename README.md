# Meraki users API

I worote this code to get access to the users interface in meraki dashbord in an API fashion, i also made a Swagger server to serve the result as actual REST API calls, the work is in prgress for now there is only one call in the API that will allow to get all the users in your network.

Run the [get_envirenement.py](get_envirenement.py) file, it will create a [meraki_env.json](meraki_env.json) file. 
note : depending on your OS you my need some access rights when runing this code, on mac you will get a reqest to allow the process to access your chrome
```
$ python get_envirenement.py "https:// your dashbord meraki api here"

open the created meraki_env.json it should be in the folwing format :

```json
{
  "csrf_token": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",

Once the file is created and it has the data, you can go ahead and run the swagger server locally go [here](python-flask-server-generated/) for details

you can use Postman to test the swagger server and get access to your netwrk users, import the postman collection file [Meraki_users.postman_collection.json](Meraki_users.postman_collection.json) into your postman, copy the content of meraki_env.json and past it as json boday for your post reqest
